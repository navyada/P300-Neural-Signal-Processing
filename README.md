# P300-Neural-Signal-Processing

This analysis was performed on data collected by an InteraXon Muse EEG Headset by Alexandre Barachant. It uses the Oddball paradigm, a method where the subject is presented with many non-target stimuli (visual, in this case), that are interjected with a few target stimuli. This experiment consisted of 6 trials of 2 minutes each. The data is open and available for download through EEG-Notebooks.

The analysis exemplifies that a Muse headband can be used to detect P300 spikes, despite the positioning of the Muse sensors being non-ideally positioned for this purpose.Â¶

This project was completed mainly for my own education. Some key takeaways:
1. MNE is a powerful tool for neural data 
2. Learned how to load raw data and manipulate it 
3. Created classification models on EEG data 
4. Understood the importance of power spectral density plots
